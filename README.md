# JSON Schema Validation

## Work In Progress. Probably shouldn't be used yet.


# Types

Types are based on the [json-schema-core identification of six primitive types](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-core.html): null, boolean, object, arry, number, and string 


# Validation
Properties for each type that are validated are based on the [json-schema-Validation Validation keywords](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-Validation.html). Verbage for each property has been changed from those presented in the json-schema-Validation document to improve the developer experience when using this tool.
